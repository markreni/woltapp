## Functionalities

- App displays a list of 15 venues for the user's current location
  - Current location is taken from the input list of 10 coordinates
  - The user location changes every 10 seconds and loops in the background.
  - Contrary to the given instructions, the app does not refresh the list automatically but the user has to double tap the screen to refresh the venues displayed on the screen. This intentional design choice aims to enhance the overall user experience. The app shows a snackbar informing the user of double tapping when the app is opened the first time.
- Each venue has a "Favorite" button next to it.

  - The button functions as a toggle (true/false) and changes the icon depending on the state.
  - Favorite states are reapplied to venues when the app is reopened.
